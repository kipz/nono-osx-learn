> [!WARNING]
> Early alpha -- not yet security audited for production use. Active development may cause breakage.


> [!NOTE]
> Claude Code Logins from within the sandbox -  there has been a regression in v0.36.0 impacting claude code logins - which we hope is now fixed in v0.37.0. If however, you're still seeing the issue, please open an issue outlining with your installation method (npm, curl, brew) along with your OS. Thanks for your patience!

Most sandboxes feel like sandboxes. Rigid, sluggish, and designed for a different problem entirely. nono was built from the ground up for AI agents - and the developer workfows they need to thrive - agent multiplexing, snapshots, credential injection, supply chain security out of the box. Develop alongside nono, then deploy anywhere: CI pipelines, Kubernetes, cloud VMs, microVMs. The one stop shop for all your clankers.

## Latest News

- **nono registry** - we will be bringing online a skill and policy registry to allow uses to contribute agent skills (SKILLS.md, hooks, scripts etc), and policy - this will allow us to more easily scale to supporting all of the different agents, installers and linux dists. Security will be baked in from the start. [Read more here](https://github.com/always-further/nono/issues/630)

- **WSL2 support** -- Auto-detection with ~84% feature coverage out of the box. Run `nono setup --check-only` to see what's available. ([#522](https://github.com/always-further/nono/pull/522))

## Quick Start

Built-in profiles for [Claude Code](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/claude-code), [Codex](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/codex), [OpenCode](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/opencode), [OpenClaw](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/openclaw), and [Swival](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/swival) -- or [define your own](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/features/profiles-groups).

## Libraries and Bindings

The core is a Rust library that can be embedded into any application. Policy-free - it applies only what clients explicitly request.

```rust
use nono::{CapabilitySet, Sandbox};

let mut caps = CapabilitySet::new();
caps.allow_read("/data/models")?;
caps.allow_write("/tmp/workspace")?;

Sandbox::apply(&caps)?;  // Irreversible -- kernel-enforced from here on
```

#### <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/python/python-original.svg" width="18" height="18" alt="Python"/> Python — [nono-py](https://github.com/always-further/nono-py)

```python
from nono_py import CapabilitySet, AccessMode, apply

caps = CapabilitySet()
caps.allow_path("/data/models", AccessMode.READ)
caps.allow_path("/tmp/workspace", AccessMode.READ_WRITE)

apply(caps)  # Apply CapabilitySet
```

#### <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/typescript/typescript-original.svg" width="18" height="18" alt="TypeScript"/> TypeScript — [nono-ts](https://github.com/always-further/nono-ts)

```typescript
import { CapabilitySet, AccessMode, apply } from "nono-ts";

const caps = new CapabilitySet();
caps.allowPath("/data/models", AccessMode.Read);
caps.allowPath("/tmp/workspace", AccessMode.ReadWrite);

apply(caps);  // Irreversible — kernel-enforced from here on
```

---

## Features

### Kernel-Enforced Sandbox

nono applies OS-level restrictions that cannot be bypassed or escalated from within the sandboxed process. Permissions are defined as capabilities granted before execution -- once the sandbox is applied, it is irreversible. All child processes inherit the same restrictions.

| Platform | Mechanism | Minimum Kernel |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| macOS | Seatbelt | 10.5+ |
| Linux | Landlock | 5.13+ |

```bash
# Grant read to src, write to output — everything else is denied by the kernel
nono run --read ./src --write ./output -- cargo build
```

### Credential Injection

Two modes: **proxy injection** keeps credentials entirely outside the sandbox — the agent connects to `localhost` and the proxy injects real API keys into upstream requests. **Env injection** loads secrets from the OS keystore, 1Password, or Apple Passwords and injects them as environment variables before the sandbox locks.

```bash
# Proxy mode — agent never sees the API key, even in its own memory
nono run --network-profile claude-code --proxy-credential openai -- my-agent

# Env mode — simpler, but secret is in the process environment
nono run --env-credential openai_api_key --allow-cwd -- my-agent

# 1Password — map URI reference to destination env var
nono run --env-credential-map 'op://Development/OpenAI/credential' OPENAI_API_KEY --allow-cwd -- my-agent

# Apple Passwords (macOS) — map URI reference to destination env var
nono run --env-credential-map 'apple-password://github.com/alice@example.com' GITHUB_PASSWORD --allow-cwd -- my-agent
```

### Agent SKILL Provenance and Supply Chain Security

Instruction files (SKILLS.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, AGENT.MD) and associated artifacts such as scripts are a supply chain attack vector. nono cryptographically signs and verifies them using Sigstore attestation with DSSE envelopes and in-toto / SLSA style statements. It supports keyed signing (system keystore) and keyless signing (OIDC via GitHub Actions + Fulcio + Rekor). Upon execution, nono verifies the signature, checks the signing certificate against trusted roots, and validates the statement predicates (e.g. signed within the last 30 days, signed by a trusted maintainer).

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/nono-attest">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub_Action-nono--attest-2088FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=github-actions&logoColor=white" alt="nono-attest GitHub Action"/>
  </a>
</p>

Sign instruction files directly within GitHub Actions workflows. Users can then verify that files originate from the expected repository and branch, signed by a trusted maintainer.

#### Marketplace Skill Verification

Marketplace plugins installed to `~/.claude/plugins/` (prompt files, hook scripts, config) are verified as signed units before the agent can read or execute them. Each plugin directory contains a `skill-manifest.json` declaring all files, entry points, and hooks. The entire directory is signed as a multi-subject in-toto attestation with a skill-specific predicate type.

```bash
# Sign a plugin directory
nono trust sign-skill ~/.claude/plugins/my-plugin

# Verify against a trust policy
nono trust verify-skill ~/.claude/plugins/my-plugin --policy trust-policy.json
```

**Pre-exec scanning:** before the agent starts, nono discovers all plugin directories and verifies each one. Verified plugins get read-only sandbox access. Unverified or tampered plugins are denied — on macOS via Seatbelt deny rules, on Linux by exclusion from the Landlock allow-list.

**Runtime gating:** in supervised mode, the skill interceptor checks every file access against the verification cache. Files within verified skill directories are auto-granted read access. Files within unverified directories are auto-denied without prompting.

**Security properties:**

- **No TOFU** — plugins must have valid signatures from trusted publishers on first encounter
- **Predicate isolation** — skill bundles use a distinct predicate type, preventing cross-use with instruction file bundles
- **Directory completeness** — extra files on disk not in the manifest are rejected as tampering
- **Digest integrity** — every file is SHA-256 checked against the signed manifest; post-signing modifications are detected
- **Entry point containment** — manifest paths must resolve within the skill directory; symlinks pointing outside are rejected

### Network Filtering

Allowlist-based host filtering via a local proxy. The sandbox blocks all direct outbound connections — the agent can only reach explicitly allowed hosts. Cloud metadata endpoints are hardcoded as denied.

```bash
nono run --allow-proxy api.openai.com --allow-proxy api.anthropic.com -- my-agent

# Keep the claude-code profile, but allow unrestricted network for this session
nono run --profile claude-code --allow-net -- claude
```

### Supervisor and Capability Expansion

On Linux, seccomp user notification intercepts syscalls when the agent needs access outside its sandbox. The supervisor prompts the user, then injects the file descriptor directly — the agent never executes its own `open()`. Sensitive paths are never-grantable regardless of approval.

```bash
nono run --rollback --supervised --profile claude-code --allow-cwd -- claude
```

### Undo and Snapshots

Content-addressable snapshots of your working directory taken before and during sandboxed execution. SHA-256 deduplication and Merkle tree commitments for integrity verification. Interactively review and restore individual files or the entire directory. Known regenerable directories (`.git`, `target`, `node_modules`, etc.) and directories with more than 10,000 files are auto-excluded from snapshots to prevent hangs on large projects.

```bash
# Zero-flag usage — auto-excludes large/regenerable directories
nono run --rollback --allow . -- npm test

# Force-include an auto-excluded directory
nono run --rollback --rollback-include target -- cargo build

# Exclude a custom directory from rollback
nono run --rollback --rollback-exclude vendor -- go test ./...

# Disable rollback entirely
nono run --no-rollback --allow . -- npm test

nono rollback list
nono rollback restore
```

### Composable Policy Groups

Security policy defined as named groups in a single JSON file. Profiles reference groups by name — compose fine-grained policies from reusable building blocks.

```json
{
  "deny_credentials": {
    "deny": { "access": ["~/.ssh", "~/.gnupg", "~/.aws", "~/.kube"] }
  },
  "node_runtime": {
    "allow": { "read": ["~/.nvm", "~/.fnm", "~/.npm"] }
  }
}
```

### Destructive Command Blocking

Dangerous commands (`rm`, `dd`, `chmod`, `sudo`, `scp`) are blocked before execution. Override per invocation with `--allow-command` or permanently via `allowed_commands` in a profile. Block additional commands with `add_deny_commands`.

```bash
$ nono run --allow-cwd -- rm -rf /
nono: blocked command: rm

# Override per invocation
nono run --allow-cwd --allow-command rm -- rm ./temp-file.txt

# Override via profile
# { "security": { "allowed_commands": ["rm"] } }
nono run --profile my-profile -- rm /tmp/old-file.txt

# Block specific commands in a profile (add_deny_commands) — pairs with add_deny_access for sockets
# { "policy": { "add_deny_access": ["/var/run/docker.sock"], "add_deny_commands": ["docker", "kubectl"] } }
nono run --profile no-docker -- claude
```

> [!WARNING]
> Command blocking is defense-in-depth layered on top of the kernel sandbox. Commands can bypass this via `sh -c '...'` or wrapper scripts — the sandbox filesystem restrictions are the real security boundary.

### Themes

nono ships with multiple color themes inspired by popular terminal palettes. The default is **Catppuccin Mocha**.

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `mocha` | Catppuccin Mocha -- warm dark (default) |
| `latte` | Catppuccin Latte -- clean light |
| `frappe` | Catppuccin Frappe -- muted dark |
| `macchiato` | Catppuccin Macchiato -- deep vivid dark |
| `tokyo-night` | Tokyo Night -- cool blues and purples |
| `minimal` | Grayscale with orange accent |

```bash
# Per invocation
nono --theme tokyo-night run --allow-cwd -- my-agent

# Via environment variable
export NONO_THEME=latte

# Via config file (~/.config/nono/config.toml)
# [ui]
# theme = "frappe"
```

### Command Mediation

Intercept specific CLI commands inside the sandbox and apply policy before they execute. A minimal shim binary (`nono-shim`) is placed in the sandbox's `PATH` for each mediated command. When the agent invokes the command, the shim forwards the call over a Unix socket to the unsandboxed parent process, which applies policy and responds — the sandboxed process never touches the real binary or its credentials.

**Intercept actions:**

- **`respond`** — return a static response immediately, without running the real binary.
- **`capture`** — run the real binary (or a `script` via `sh -c`) and return a nonce (phantom token) to the sandbox. The real value is substituted at passthrough time, so the agent can use the token in subsequent calls without ever seeing the real secret.
- **`approve`** — run the real binary (or a `script` via `sh -c`) and return the actual output to the sandbox. Typically paired with `"admin": true` to gate sensitive-but-non-secret commands behind biometric/password approval.

**Env var blocking:** named environment variables are stripped from the child process at session start, preventing the sandbox from reading raw credentials.

**Per-command sandboxing:** each mediated command can optionally restrict the filesystem paths and network access it is allowed when the parent execs it in passthrough. This is an opt-in, per-command setting.

**Allowed commands (`allow_commands`):** when a mediated command (e.g. `gh`) runs inside its per-command sandbox, subprocesses normally route through shims. `allow_commands` lets specific commands (e.g. `ddtool`) execute directly as real binaries inside that sandbox. A filtered shim directory is created containing shims only for commands _not_ in the allow list. The allowed commands' binary directories are added to PATH and granted read access in the Seatbelt profile. Their output stays within the per-command sandbox — network restrictions prevent credential leakage.

**Socket security:** the mediation socket is protected by two layers. The session directory is created `0700` and the socket itself `0600`, so other local users cannot connect. Within the same user, a 256-bit random session token is injected into the sandboxed child as `NONO_SESSION_TOKEN`; every shim request must include it. Requests exceeding 1 MiB are dropped before allocation; requests with a missing or incorrect token are dropped after reading.

**Per-rule admin gate:** set `"admin": true` on any intercept rule to require native macOS biometric or password authentication before the action executes. Requires `nono-approve` installed alongside nono.

**YOLO mode (macOS):** the `nono-privileges` menu bar app lets you temporarily suspend all mediation for a session — authenticated via Touch ID and active for a configurable window (default 10 minutes). During this window all shim requests are forwarded as raw passthroughs. An audit log is written to the session directory.

#### Example: Credential Capture with Nonce Tokens

The agent calls `gh auth token` — the shim intercepts it, the real binary runs in the unsandboxed parent, and the sandbox receives a nonce (`nono_abc123...`) instead of the real token. When the agent later calls `gh api user`, the nonce is promoted to the real value at passthrough time.

```json
{
  "mediation": {
    "env": { "block": ["GH_TOKEN", "GITHUB_TOKEN"] },
    "commands": [
      {
        "name": "gh",
        "intercept": [
          {
            "args_prefix": ["auth", "token"],
            "action": { "type": "capture" }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Example: Static Responses

Return a canned response without running the real binary. The agent sees a realistic output but no real operation occurs.

```json
{
  "args_prefix": ["auth", "status"],
  "action": {
    "type": "respond",
    "stdout": "github.com\n  Logged in to github.com account kipz\n"
  }
}
```

#### Example: Admin-Gated Approval

Gate sensitive commands behind Touch ID / password via `nono-approve`. The `approve` action runs the real command and returns the actual output — unlike `capture`, no nonce wrapping occurs.

```json
{
  "args_prefix": ["ssh-key", "list"],
  "admin": true,
  "action": { "type": "approve" }
}
```

If the user denies the prompt, the shim returns exit code 126 and a "was not approved" message. If approved, the real output is returned to the sandbox.

#### Example: Per-Command Sandbox with `allow_commands`

Restrict `gh` to GitHub hosts only, but let it call `ddtool` directly inside its sandbox to fetch a token from the macOS Keychain. The `ddtool` binary runs as a real process (not through the shim) inside `gh`'s network-restricted sandbox — the token is used internally and never leaks to the primary sandbox.

```json
{
  "mediation": {
    "env": { "block": ["GH_TOKEN", "GITHUB_TOKEN"] },
    "commands": [
      {
        "name": "gh",
        "intercept": [
          { "args_prefix": ["auth", "token"], "action": { "type": "capture" } }
        ],
        "sandbox": {
          "network": {
            "allowed_hosts": ["github.com", "*.github.com", "api.github.com"]
          },
          "fs_read": ["~/.config/gh", "~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db"],
          "allow_commands": ["ddtool"]
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "ddtool",
        "intercept": [
          { "args_prefix": ["auth", "github", "token"], "action": { "type": "capture" } }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

How this works:

1. Agent calls `gh api user` — the shim forwards it to the mediation server.
2. The server execs the real `gh` binary inside a per-command Seatbelt sandbox (network restricted to `github.com`).
3. The `gh` wrapper internally calls `ddtool auth github token` — because `ddtool` is in `allow_commands`, it resolves to the real binary (no shim), reads the Keychain, and returns the token.
4. The wrapper sets `GH_TOKEN` and calls the real `gh` binary, which hits the GitHub API through the allowlisted proxy.
5. At the top level, `ddtool auth github token` called directly by the agent still routes through the shim and returns a nonce — credentials are never exposed to the sandbox.

#### Example: Full Profile

Combining all capabilities — credential capture, static responses, admin-gated approval, per-command sandboxing, and allowed commands:

```json
{
  "mediation": {
    "env": { "block": ["GH_TOKEN", "GITHUB_TOKEN"] },
    "commands": [
      {
        "name": "gh",
        "intercept": [
          {
            "args_prefix": ["auth", "token"],
            "action": { "type": "capture" }
          },
          {
            "args_prefix": ["auth", "status"],
            "action": {
              "type": "respond",
              "stdout": "github.com\n  Logged in to github.com account kipz\n"
            }
          },
          {
            "args_prefix": ["ssh-key", "list"],
            "admin": true,
            "action": { "type": "approve" }
          }
        ],
        "sandbox": {
          "network": {
            "allowed_hosts": ["github.com", "*.github.com", "api.github.com"]
          },
          "fs_read": ["~/.config/gh", "~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db"],
          "allow_commands": ["ddtool"]
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "ddtool",
        "intercept": [
          {
            "args_prefix": ["auth", "github", "token"],
            "action": { "type": "capture" }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Supported Clients

nono ships with built-in profiles for popular AI coding agents. Each profile defines audited, minimal permissions.

| Client | Profile | Docs |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Claude Code** | `claude-code` | [Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/claude-code) |
| **Codex** | `codex` | [Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/codex) |
| **OpenCode** | `opencode` | [Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/opencode) |
| **OpenClaw** | `openclaw` | [Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/openclaw) |
| **Swival** | `swival` | [Guide](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/clients/swival) |

Custom profiles can [extend built-in ones](https://docs.nono.sh/cli/features/profiles-groups) with `"extends": "claude-code"` (or multiple: `"extends": ["claude-code", "node-dev"]`) to inherit all settings and add overrides. nono is agent-agnostic and works with any CLI command. See the [full documentation](https://docs.nono.sh) for usage details, configuration, and integration guides.

## Projects using nono

| Project | Repository |
|---------|------------|
| **claw-wrap** | [GitHub](https://github.com/dedene/claw-wrap) |

## Architecture

nono is structured as a Cargo workspace:

- **nono** (`crates/nono/`) -- Core library. A policy-free sandbox primitive that applies only what clients explicitly request.
- **nono-cli** (`crates/nono-cli/`) -- CLI binary. Owns all security policy, profiles, hooks, and UX.
- **nono-shim** (`crates/nono-shim/`) -- Minimal shim binary used by command mediation. Placed in the sandbox PATH for each mediated command; forwards invocations to the parent mediation server over a Unix socket.
- **nono-approve** (`crates/nono-approve/`) -- Native macOS authentication binary. Invoked by the mediation server when an intercept rule sets `admin: true`; shows a biometric/password dialog via LocalAuthentication and returns exit code 0 (allow) or 1 (deny).
- **nono-privileges** (`apps/nono-privileges/`) -- macOS menu bar app for YOLO mode. Authenticates via Touch ID and sends enable/disable commands to the session's control socket.
- **nono-ffi** (`bindings/c/`) -- C FFI bindings with auto-generated header.

Language-specific bindings are maintained separately:
